      Hi! My name is David Boles. I'm currently a senior at <a href="https://www.designtechhighschool.org/">Design Tech High School</a>. I enjoy interdisciplinary engineering, and as such have had a lot of fun in our <a href="https://www.team5940.org/">FRC robotics team</a>. I also have fun thinking about philosophy and doing ceramics, both of which I've gotten to explore through community college classes. Not sure what else to say!

    I enjoy learning new things and classes give me a structured way to do that. I have a pretty busy schedule and have found that CS is easier than other subjects to take online. This semester I was planning to take Introduction to DevOps but I ended up doing some work with Gradle and Travis-CI before the semester started so it became less interesting to me. I also recognize that some more formal training in web technologies would do me a lot of good and I've never developed anything for mobile. Anyway, here I am!
